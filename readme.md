> This Terraform file is used to configure network access rules to the server. This security group opens inbound access for SSH, HTTP/HTTPS, as well as several application and monitoring ports that can be added, such as Jenkins, SonarQube, Prometheus, Grafana, and Node Exporter, while outbound rules allow all outgoing traffic without restrictions.

> Playbook ini digunakan untuk menyiapkan Docker Private Registry pada server monitoring dengan sistem autentikasi menggunakan htpasswd (bcrypt). Registry dijalankan sebagai container Docker dengan data dan konfigurasi autentikasi yang bersifat persisten. Setelah registry aktif, dilakukan pengecekan endpoint untuk memastikan layanan berjalan dan akses tanpa autentikasi ditolak.

> This playbook is used to install and set up Docker Engine on all hosts. The process includes updating the system repository, installing supporting dependencies, adding the GPG key and official Docker repository, installing Docker Engine and its components, ensuring that the Docker service runs automatically, and adding users to the docker group so that they can run Docker without root access.

## 3. deploy

> Displaying containers running on the server: frontend, backend, MySQL, and private Docker registry. All services are active and each has been exposed to the appropriate port for application, database, and registry access.

### FRONTEND

This frontend site is built using [GitHub Pages Frontend](https://github.com/FauzanPM/wayshub_fe.git).
> <img width="1455" height="667" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7eb59f5-10de-497c-ba5c-92903b52f59b" />
> This Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build for Node.js-based frontend applications. The first stage is used to install dependencies and build the application, while the second stage only runs the build results with PM2 to make it lighter and more stable. The application is exposed on port 3000 and runs using pm2-runtime for production needs.

> <img width="1449" height="820" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37144ff0-8dc0-4285-a6f5-2ecbf3b926c7" />

> This workflow automates the process of building, pushing, and deploying frontend applications. The pipeline runs when there is a push to the main branch, builds a Docker image, sends it to a private registry, and then deploys it to the server via SSH by running the frontend container on port 3000.

> <img width="1441" height="723" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdbae117-820c-449e-a9bb-d6741c42f0e6" />
> This file configures the Axios client for the frontend, with a baseURL to the backend API. The setAuthToken function is available to add or remove the Authorization Bearer token in the header of each API request.

> <img width="1889" height="964" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87eca021-6b6f-427a-bf77-8afccf720521" />

> If the frontend deployment is successful, it can be accessed via the URL https.


### 4. BACKEND

This backend site is built using [GitHub Pages Backend](https://github.com/FauzanPM/wayshub_be.git).
> <img width="1444" height="588" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a41564b-292c-4891-94a1-3d73eee2c189" />
> Used to build and run Node.js-based backend applications using a multi-stage method. The build stage installs dependencies, then the runtime stage runs the application using PM2 for greater stability in production.
>
> <img width="1446" height="860" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6000dd5-4656-4909-8156-2b40ae789b4e" />
> Sequelize configuration file that defines database connections for development, test, and production environments, including credentials, host, and MySQL dialect.
>
> <img width="1435" height="882" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b2a5022-504a-4406-b431-cc3d7b2ad42d" />
> Used to run MySQL 5.7 in a Docker container, complete with user, database, port, and volume configurations to keep database data persistent.
>
> <img width="1429" height="892" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72a1a165-461c-409c-ba42-dc5cf2e70a16" />

> This workflow automates the build, push, and deploy processes for the backend. Every push to the main branch triggers the backend image to be built and pushed to the private registry. The server then pulls the latest image, ensures the MySQL container is running, starts the backend container, and executes database migrations (Sequelize) after the application is active.
>
> <img width="1897" height="972" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44b052c5-68c2-4198-a8ef-beaa68b35441" />

> If the backend and database deployment is successful, the website will be able to register and log in.

> <img width="1894" height="927" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0abe2513-69cd-40e5-8314-06fef91496a3" />
> This step ensures that the MySQL container is running correctly and that the Wayshub database has been successfully created and populated. The tables resulting from the Sequelize migration are visible, and the data in the Channels table has been successfully stored, indicating that the backend is connected to the database and that CRUD operations are running normally.


## 5. Monitoring

> This playbook is used to deploy Node Exporter on all servers (appserver2, gateway, and monitoring). Its function is to create a monitoring directory on the server, send the Node Exporter Docker Compose file, and then run the Node Exporter container using Docker Compose so that server system metrics can be collected by Prometheus.

> <img width="1882" height="582" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d35af648-310a-49b9-9730-3e078c07726e" />
