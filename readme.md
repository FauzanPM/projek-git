> This playbook is used to configure SSL/TLS on Nginx reverse proxy on the gateway server using Let's Encrypt wildcard certificates. All application services, CI/CD, and monitoring are accessed via HTTPS with an automatic redirect mechanism from HTTP to HTTPS.
> 
> This playbook creates reverse proxy configurations for frontend and backend in production and staging environments, as well as supporting services such as Jenkins, Docker Registry, Grafana, Prometheus, and Node Exporter. Each domain is directed to the appropriate service based on the internal port of each container or application.
> 
> In addition to SSL implementation, this configuration also forwards standard headers (Host, X-Real-IP, X-Forwarded-*) so that the backend application continues to receive the original request information from the client. For Prometheus, basic authentication is implemented to restrict access to the monitoring dashboard.
> 
> Once all configurations are complete, the playbook will validate the Nginx configuration and reload the Nginx service without downtime so that all changes take effect immediately.
